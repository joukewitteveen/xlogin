These files make it possible to login to X without a desktop manager.

Usage
=====

To enable automatic login at boot, execute:
# systemctl enable xlogin@<username>

The xlogin service sets up a user session and runs the .xinitrc script of the
user. Several actions are available to the user.

Logout
------
$ loginctl terminate-session "$XDG_SESSION_ID"
or
$ systemctl --user exit

Shutdown
--------
$ systemctl poweroff
If no other users are logged in, this does not require a password.

Reboot
------
$ systemctl reboot
If no other users are logged in, this does not require a password.


Files
=====

Makefile
--------
This makes installation through
# make install
possible.

x-daemon
--------
This script makes starting X as a daemon possible. It is needed by the systemd
service that manages X.

x@.service
----------
This service governs an X session on a specified VT. It is of little use on its
own.

xlogin@.service
---------------
This service is responsible for setting up the user session and running the
user's .xinitrc script. The script should not return.

25-xlogin
---------
This script makes sure the systemd user dbus socket is not reused for the
user's X session. Its invocation is guaranteed by having the following on top
of your .xinitrc:

    if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ]; then
        for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/*; do
            [ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
        done
        unset f
    fi

As a consequence, systemd commands that interface the user session will no
longer be able to communicate with the systemd instance. To alleviate this
problem, include the following in your .bashrc:

    for sd_cmd in systemctl systemd-analyze systemd-run; do
        alias $sd_cmd='DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:path=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/dbus/user_bus_socket" '$sd_cmd
    done

Service files for setting up the session bus socket are not provided by xlogin.
